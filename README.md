# Bear Connect

Members: Justin Norman, Dylan Chow, Elaine Wang, Hongyang Zheng, Nidhi Kakulawaram

We plan on building the backend for an app that connects students who are taking similar classes, so that they can form study groups. Users can create profiles that specify the classes they are taking, study habits, preferred meeting times, year, major, and hobbies. Users can choose to join an existing group, or start a group with another student. Students will be able to message each other directly on the platform. We plan on using FireBase for authentication and storing user data, and the Twilio chat API.

Run ```./demo.sh``` in the project's root directory to start docker containers.
